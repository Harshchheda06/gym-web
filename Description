 This project is a combination  of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and SQL being used together to create a dynamic website with user registration, 
   login functionality, and membership management.

Here's a summary of the features and technologies I have incorporated:

1. User Registration: I have added a user registration form using HTML, and the form data is processed using PHP. I have implemented the logic to insert
  the user information into the database table.

2. Form Validation: I have incorporated JavaScript (JS) for form validation, ensuring that users enter valid data before submitting the form.
  This helps maintain data integrity and improves the user experience.

3. Database Interaction: I have utilized PHP to establish a connection with the database and perform various database operations, such as creating tables, 
inserting data fetched from the form, and retrieving user data for display. This enables seamless communication between my website and the database.

4. Login Validation: During the login process, I have implemented password validation to ensure secure authentication. PHP is used to compare the entered 
  password with the stored password in the database, verifying the user's credentials.

5. Printing User Data: I have integrated PHP to retrieve user data from the database, including name, phone number, joining date, expiration date,
and membership duration. This data is then displayed on the website, providing users with relevant information. This  is done using SESSIONS to remember
  user information.

6. Admin Functionality: I have implemented additional functionalities for admins, including the ability to add memberships, renew existing memberships, 
search for members, and view all members on a single page. These tasks are accomplished using PHP and SQL queries to interact with the database.

7. Highlighting Expired Memberships: In the admin view of all members, I have incorporated a feature to highlight members whose memberships have expired. 
  This visual indication helps with easy identification and management of expired memberships.

8.Home page includes a casourel of images of gym followed by attractive boxes containing gym faciities followed by table displaying various memberships
  options.
